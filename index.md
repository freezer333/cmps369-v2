This course provides in-depth treatment of the critical languages, design patterns, and technologies underpinning all of modern web application development. The basics of networking, along with the details of the HTTP protocol are introduced. HTML, CSS are presented from the perspective of an application developer. JavaScript is covered as the primary language for both client side development and server side (utilizing the node.js platform).

Advanced JavaScript topics such as closures and asynchronous programming are covered in depth. The course also introduces the MVC (Model View Controller) architecture for web development and covers the Express framework including PUG templating, along with front-end tools like LESS, Bootstrap, and Vue.

An overview of other popular languages and frameworks such as, Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and PHP are also provided to increase the breadth of the students’ knowledge in the field.

Students will complete several projects throughout the semester, culminating in a fully deployed web application at a domain name of their own.

Note, this course is taught under the assumption that the student has programming knowledge and experience in an object-oriented language such as C++ or Java, as it JavaScript is used extensively throughout the semester. The emphasis of this course is web development from an application programmer’s perspective. It is a technical course, not suitable for students without an adequate background in computer science.

## Expectations for an online course
This course is online, and asynchronous - meaning you can access course material at any time.  While all modules/assignments are accessible from this site, we will use [Canvas](https://ramapo.instructure.com/) to submit all programming assignments electronically. 

**There are no required class meetings or lectures** for an online course at Ramapo College.  My lectures will be pre-recorded and available on this site and on Canvas.  Each week, a new set of lecture videos and materials will be posted.

If you have never taken an online course, you may be surprised how easy it is to fall behind. Below I have explained the way the course is organized, and if anything is unclear please email me ASAP. The number one thing to remember is that you need to keep pace with the content on Canvas, making sure that you master each week’s modules on a consistent basis. Computer science, perhaps more than any other subject, builds from lesson to lesson. There is no lesson/module that can be safely “skipped” - they will all come back to haunt you if you don’t understand them (or don’t try to learn them!). So please - keep up with the work!

## How to get help:
I will respond to emails very quickly, so whenever you are struggling with a concept, program, or anything else - please get in touch. It is best to send me your code as an attachment with any email, so I can see precisely what you are doing. I will hold office hours by appointment, just email me and we'll work out a time to meet via WebEx. 

## Course Requirements
This course is taught under the assumption that the student has programming knowledge and experience in an object-oriented language such as C++ or Java, as it JavaScript is used extensively throughout the semester. The emphasis of this course is web development from an application programmer’s perspective. It is a technical course, not suitable for students without an adequate background in computer science.

### Textbooks
Textbooks are resources, not assigned reading.  I encourage you to purchase a copy of these books, but I will not assign specific questions from the text.

### Web Hosting
The culminating project in this course will be a deployed web application, to your own domain name.

Domain names are inexpensive, and they can be found for under $10/year.  I will provide detailed instructions for creating a domain name during the semester.

You will also be requried to create an account on [Render.com](https://render.com/), which we will use free services.

You will need a credit card/debit card to purchas the domain name.  Please contact me directly if you have any issues with this, and I can work with you.

## Canvas
All content is available on this site, however in order see due dates, submit your work, and see your grades, you will need to login to the [Canvas learning management system](https://ramapo.instructure.com/).  

## Topics & Schedule
Each week during the semester you will be provided pre-recorded video lectures and additional online resources and activites.  

*Please check back here, or on Canvas, throughout the semester.  I will be updating the slide listings, videos, and resources each week.*

## Recitations
Recitations are virtual (WebEx) meetings that I will hold once a week.  These meeting are **optional** for all students.  Each week, I will review essential materials we are covering during the week, but you can also think of the recitation as **collaborative office hours**.  If there is a project coming up, we might focus on project questions.  If there is some specific material that I'm getting lots of questions about, I'll discuss those concepts in more depth.  The sessions are semi-structured.  

I strongly encourage you to attend recitations.  We won't waste anytime - I'll focus on some things that I think are important, and I'll ask for students to bring questions.  They will be scheduled to last one hour, and if we don't have much to discuss, we'll end early!

Recitations will begin on Tuesday, January 18th.  We will follow an **alternating** schedule, meeting Tuesday one week, then Thursday, and then Tuesday.  You will receive a WebEx invitation to these recitations at the beginning of the semester.

## Programming Environment
This course will require you to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. A simple text editor is all that is necessary, however installing a good programming editor is highly recommended. In addition, you will also need to install Node.js. Node.js is available on all major operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux).

It is highly recommended that you have access to your own computer to do your development on, most machines in college labs will not have Node.js installed. However, for assignments only dealing with client-side programming, you may be able to use any machine in the labs.

While your basic text editor will allow you to write HTML/CSS and JavaScript, it can be quite error prone without automatic indentation and syntax highlighting. There are many possibilities.

- [Microsoft's VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - runs on Windows, Mac OSX, Linux. Free
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - runs on Windows, Mac OSX, Linux. (Note, the free trial works forever...)
    
If you wish, you can also use larger integrated development environments (IDE), such as Microsoft Visual Studio or eclipse, Web Storm, etc. Use of a full-fledged IDE is not necessary however, and most web developers prefer to use light-weight editors such as those listed above.

## Weekly Checkins
Each week I will assign a "check in", which will be a short multiple choice-styled quiz, on Canvas.  These checkins will not take more than 15-20 minutes of your time, and are designed to highlight and self-assess your understanding and progress through the course materials.

Weekly checkins are due each Friday at 11:59pm, and no makeups are permitted.  They will account for 25% of your grade.

## Projects
Please check Canvas for due dates for all projects.  Projects will account for 75% of your semester grade.
- [Project 1](projects/p1.html) Static HTML webserver with structured data -- 10% of semester grade
- [Project 2](projects/p2.html) Contact list with Express and Pug -- 22.5% of semester grade*
- [Project 3](projects/p3.html) Styling the Contact List with CSS -- 10% of semester grade
- [Project 4](projects/p4.html) Mapping your Contacts with JavaScript -- 10% of semester grade
- [Project 5](projects/p5.html) Contact list SPA with Vue -- 22.5% of semester grade*

*Note that Projects 2 and 5 will be graded via a live demo (1:1 with me and your team), which will include a short code review.*

## Letter Grade Assignment
The following table is used to compute your letter grade, based on the numeric (weighted) average you earn during the semester.

| Letter | Numeric Score | Letter | Numeric Score | Letter | Numeric Score
|--------|---------------| ------ | ------------- | ------ | -------------
| A      | 100-94        |A-      | 93-90         |        |
| B+     | 89-87         | B      | 86-84         | B-     | 83-80 
| C+     | 79-77         |C       | 76-74         |C-      | 73-70
|D+      | 69-67         |D       | 66-60         |F       | < 60 

## Academic Integrity
Students are expected to read and understand Ramapo College’s Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found in the Ramapo College Catalog.  Members of the Ramapo College community are expected to be honest and forthright in their academic endeavors.  Students who are suspected of violating this policy will be referred to the Office of the Provost.

**Please read a detailed description of my policy on academic integrity [here](../../integrity.html)**

When completing lab programming exercises, you may review code with your fellow students; however, copying source code is strictly forbidden.  For homework programming assignments, you may discuss ideas, however you may not allow others to see your source code or examine others’.  Sharing of source code is extremely easy to detect and is strictly prohibited.   If sharing of source code is suspected, intentional or otherwise, both parties will immediately be referred to the Office of the Provost.

## College-Wide Policies
Please see the [College’s web page](https://www.ramapo.edu/fa/arc/college-wide-policies-courses) on policies that apply to all RCNJ courses, including this one.
